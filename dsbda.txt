What is the full form of pandas?
A: Python Data Analysis Library.

What is pandas used for?
A: It’s used for data manipulation and analysis.

What does pd.read_csv() do?
A: It reads data from a CSV file into a DataFrame.

How can you view the first few records of a DataFrame?
A: Using data.head().

What does data.tail() return?
A: The last 5 rows of the DataFrame.

How can you find the number of rows and columns?
A: Using data.shape.

How do you check for null or missing values?
A: With data.isna().sum().

What does data.describe() provide?
A: Summary statistics of numeric columns.

What is a DataFrame?
A: A 2D, tabular data structure with labeled axes.

What is the purpose of ["Age", "EstimatedSalary"] in your code?
A: To select those two columns as features.

What is the Purchased column used for?
A: It is the target variable (label) in classification.

What does train_test_split() do?
A: Splits data into training and testing sets.

What is test_size=0.2?
A: It sets aside 20% of the data for testing.

Why use random_state=0?
A: To make results reproducible.

Which algorithm are you using in the code?
A: Logistic Regression.

Is Logistic Regression a classification or regression algorithm?
A: It is a classification algorithm.

What type of problem does your dataset represent?
A: Binary classification.

How do you train a logistic regression model?
A: Using model.fit(xtrain, ytrain).

What does y_pred = model.predict(xtest) do?
A: Predicts class labels for the test data.

What does confusion_matrix() return?
A: A matrix showing true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

What is a true positive?
A: When the model correctly predicts the positive class.

What is a false positive?
A: When the model incorrectly predicts the positive class.

What is a true negative?
A: When the model correctly predicts the negative class.

What is a false negative?
A: When the model incorrectly predicts the negative class.

How is accuracy calculated?
A: Accuracy =𝑇𝑃 + 𝑇𝑁 / 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙

What function is used to scale features in sklearn?
A: StandardScaler() from sklearn.preprocessing.
​
 Q: Why did you choose Age and Salary?
A: These are the most relevant features that might influence someone's buying decision. People with certain age ranges or income levels might be more likely to purchase.

Q: What does the model output?
A: It gives a 0 or 1 — where 1 means the model predicts the person will buy, and 0 means they won't.

Q: Can your model give a probability instead of just 0 or 1?
A: Yes! Using model.predict_proba(), we can get the probability that a person will buy the product.

How does your model work? (Simple Explanation)
“We are using a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a person will buy a product (like an ad on a social network) or not.
The prediction is based on two input features:

Age

Estimated Salary

The target variable is Purchased, which is either 1 (yes) or 0 (no).
The model learns from historical data — it identifies patterns between people’s age/salary and whether they purchased or not — and then uses that to make predictions on new data.”
