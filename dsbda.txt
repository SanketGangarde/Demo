What is the full form of pandas?
A: Python Data Analysis Library.

What is pandas used for?
A: It’s used for data manipulation and analysis.

What does pd.read_csv() do?
A: It reads data from a CSV file into a DataFrame.

How can you view the first few records of a DataFrame?
A: Using data.head().

What does data.tail() return?
A: The last 5 rows of the DataFrame.

How can you find the number of rows and columns?
A: Using data.shape.

How do you check for null or missing values?
A: With data.isna().sum().

What does data.describe() provide?
A: Summary statistics of numeric columns.

What is a DataFrame?
A: A 2D, tabular data structure with labeled axes.

What is the purpose of ["Age", "EstimatedSalary"] in your code?
A: To select those two columns as features.

What is the Purchased column used for?
A: It is the target variable (label) in classification.

What does train_test_split() do?
A: Splits data into training and testing sets.

What is test_size=0.2?
A: It sets aside 20% of the data for testing.

Why use random_state=0?
A: To make results reproducible.

Which algorithm are you using in the code?
A: Logistic Regression.

Is Logistic Regression a classification or regression algorithm?
A: It is a classification algorithm.

What type of problem does your dataset represent?
A: Binary classification.

How do you train a logistic regression model?
A: Using model.fit(xtrain, ytrain).

What does y_pred = model.predict(xtest) do?
A: Predicts class labels for the test data.

What does confusion_matrix() return?
A: A matrix showing true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

What is a true positive?
A: When the model correctly predicts the positive class.

What is a false positive?
A: When the model incorrectly predicts the positive class.

What is a true negative?
A: When the model correctly predicts the negative class.

What is a false negative?
A: When the model incorrectly predicts the negative class.

How is accuracy calculated?
A: Accuracy =𝑇𝑃 + 𝑇𝑁 / 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙

What function is used to scale features in sklearn?
A: StandardScaler() from sklearn.preprocessing.
​
 Q: Why did you choose Age and Salary?
A: These are the most relevant features that might influence someone's buying decision. People with certain age ranges or income levels might be more likely to purchase.

Q: What does the model output?
A: It gives a 0 or 1 — where 1 means the model predicts the person will buy, and 0 means they won't.

Q: Can your model give a probability instead of just 0 or 1?
A: Yes! Using model.predict_proba(), we can get the probability that a person will buy the product.

How does your model work? (Simple Explanation)
“We are using a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a person will buy a product (like an ad on a social network) or not.
The prediction is based on two input features:

Age

Estimated Salary

The target variable is Purchased, which is either 1 (yes) or 0 (no).
The model learns from historical data — it identifies patterns between people’s age/salary and whether they purchased or not — and then uses that to make predictions on new data.”



What is Data Wrangling?
Data Wrangling (also called data munging) is the process of:

Collecting raw data.

Cleaning missing, inconsistent, or incorrect values.

Transforming and reshaping data to make it usable for analysis or modeling.


 Categorical Values (Qualitative Data)
These are discrete values that represent categories or labels.

Meaning: They describe qualities or characteristics.

Examples:

Gender: Male, Female

City: Pune, Delhi, Mumbai

Blood type: A, B, AB, O

Types:

Nominal: No natural order (e.g., city, gender)

Ordinal: Have a logical order (e.g., Low, Medium, High)

 Continuous Values (Quantitative Data)
These are numeric values that can take any value within a range.

Meaning: They describe quantities or measurable things.

Examples:

Height: 170.5 cm

Weight: 60.2 kg

Age: 21

Price: 99.99

Can be decimals or integers.

axis=0 → Rows

axis=1 → Columns

groupby in Pandas is a super useful tool when you want to group data based on one or more columns and then perform some operation (like sum, mean, count, etc.) on each group.

Linear Regression
✅ Use it when the target (output) is continuous — meaning, it can take on any real number. i.e Output is a numeric value.

Logistic Regression
✅ Use it when the target is categorical (usually binary — like Yes/No, 0/1, True/False).


🌳 Where Do We Use Decision Trees?
✅ Decision Trees are used for:
Classification (categorical output)
Regression (continuous output)
Handles both numeric & categorical	    Can work with both types of data
Works well with missing data	          Can make decisions even if some data is missing

 Use in Regression
When your target is a numeric value, like:
Predicting house price
Estimating age from certain features
Predicting demand for a produc

What is a Scatter Plot?
A scatter plot is a graph that uses dots to represent the values of two numeric variables.
Each dot shows one observation in the dataset.


🔹 Matplotlib
✅ Use When:
You need full control over every aspect of the plot (customization).
You are building complex or multi-step visualizations.
You want to embed plots into applications (e.g., with Tkinter or Flask).

You are working with basic plots like:
Line plot
Bar chart
Scatter plot
Histogram

🔸 Seaborn
✅ Use When:
You want beautiful, statistical visualizations quickly.
You are working with DataFrames (Seaborn works directly with pandas).
You want to analyze patterns in categorical or numerical data.

You want plots like:

Box plot
Violin plot
Heatmap
Pair plot
Distribution plot


What is a Confusion Matrix?  use to comparing actual and predicted values.

✅ Terms You Should Know:
True Positive (TP): Model predicted yes, and it was actually yes.

True Negative (TN): Model predicted no, and it was actually no.

False Positive (FP): Model predicted yes, but it was no. (Type I Error)

False Negative (FN): Model predicted no, but it was yes. (Type II Error)
